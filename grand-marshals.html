            If you've lived in LaVerkin for more than five minutes, chances are you know Alan and Paula Beatty - or at least you've waved to them while driving down Main Street. These two small-town sweethearts have been part of the heart and humor of LaVerkin life for more than five decades, and this year, they're trading their usual seats along the parade route for the best spot of all - right up front as the 2025 Winterfest Grand Marshals.

              <p>
                Alan Sant Beatty was born on March 7, 1950, in Hurricane, Utah, to Donald and Evelyn Beatty. The youngest of five boys, Alan learned early that a quick wit and a good sense of humor were survival skills. Paula Gubler Beatty was born a year and a few days later, on March 15, 1951, to Lyman and Norene Gubler in LaVerkin, Utah – the second of six children and a master of keeping her brothers in line (a skill that came in handy later).
              </p>
              <p>
                They both attended school in Hurricane, where they knew of each other, cheered at the same games, and probably passed each other in the halls without realizing their future was just around the corner. After high school, Alan served an LDS mission in Scotland (where he picked up a love for kilts and storytelling), while Paula attended Dixie College.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fate brought them back together when they worked in a church calling with single adults – turns out love was closer than either expected! A friendship soon turned into something more, and by November 20, 1971, they sealed the deal and began their adventure together.
              </p>
              <p>
                After a short stay in Hurricane, Paula convinced Alan to "cross the bridge" and settle in LaVerkin – where they've been ever since. Fifty-four years, six children, 26 grandkids, and 10 great-grandkids later, they've built a legacy filled with laughter, love, and plenty of good stories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alan has served his community in just about every way possible – volunteer fireman, town board member, LDS Bishop, and even campaign manager for the current LaVerkin mayor. Paula has lent her heart and hands to countless city events and committees, including helping launch Winterfest itself. She now works at Hurricane Middle School – after being "fired" by her baby brother, who, we might add, she helped raise into the fine man he is today! (Family dinners are still lively, don't worry.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Together, Alan and Paula have been the kind of neighbors, leaders, and friends that make small towns special. They love this community, and it shows in everything they do.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not bad for a couple of small-town kids who just wanted to make a difference – one laugh, one project, and one parade at a time.
